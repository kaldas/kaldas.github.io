Last week I had my very first Hackathon with my current employer. We were free to work on any ideas we wanted to and to team up with anyone in the company. We had the Hackathon kickoff at the Churchill War Rooms in Westminster with a very motivating speech from the CEO about how we are directly fighting poverty world wide. I got in a cross functional team with people from almost every engineering team and we picked up bringing blockchain technology to the business.

Being already a financial institution, we decided to look at blockchain as a ledger for our existing business flow, more like smart contracts, instead of as a crypto currency like Bitcoin. This is when we found about Stellar.

They are a payment scheme built on top of blockchain technology where financial institutions can join as anchor nodes and make the bridge between the real world hard currency/fiat money and the e-money. We built a walking skeleton within the given two day time frame and I was very satisfied with the outcome.
