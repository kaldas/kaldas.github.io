Last week I had my first Hackaton at WorldRemit. We were free to work on any idea we wanted to and to team up with anyone in the company. We had the Hackaton kickoff at the Churchill War Rooms in Westminster with a very motivating speech from the CEO about how we are directly fighting poverty world wide. I got in a cross functional team with people from almost every engineering team and we decided to look into bringing blockchain technology to the business.
