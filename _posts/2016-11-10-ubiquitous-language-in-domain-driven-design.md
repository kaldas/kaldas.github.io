Before I moved to London I worked for various firms in Brazil and one of them was the national telephone company. When I worked there I found a great example of Ubiquitous language within bounded contexts and this was the word TELEPHONE.

In the bounded context of the operations department a telephone was what they installed at customers houses

For the telematicâ€™s department a telephone meant a number within an area code which was either being a caller or a callee

For finance a telephone meant a monthly bill

This is why every bounded context has its own ubiquitous language and why the anti-corruption pattern between bounded contexts is so important in domain driven design.
