I'm thrilled to say that I had the opportunity to attend another QCon this year! As a software developer, I'm always eager to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and advancements. QCon is a conference that never fails to deliver on that front.

From the moment I arrived at the conference venue, I could feel the excitement and energy buzzing in the air. I was surrounded by fellow developers and engineers who share my passion for innovation and cutting-edge technology.

During the conference, I was particularly drawn to the track on building modern backends because it aligns closely with the work I have been doing. The speakers offered valuable insights and practical advice on how to build scalable and efficient backends using the latest technologies and best practices.

I had the opportunity to attend a talk that focused on the topic of moving from cloud-hosted to cloud-native solutions. The speaker, a seasoned expert in the field, shared his insights and experiences in helping companies transition their applications and infrastructure to cloud-native environments.

What particularly caught my attention was the speaker's emphasis on the importance of understanding the benefits and challenges of cloud-native solutions before making the transition. She highlighted that while cloud-native solutions offer many advantages, such as greater scalability and flexibility, they require a different approach to application design and development.

The speaker also shared practical advice on how to make the transition to cloud-native environments, including selecting the right cloud provider, using the appropriate cloud services, and investing in the right tools and technologies. She stressed the importance of a gradual and thoughtful approach to the transition, taking time to evaluate the organization's needs and goals, and building a plan that is tailored to its specific requirements.

## Final Thoughts

Attending QCon is always an incredible experience, and this year was no exception. I feel incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to attend and learn from some of the best in the industry. I'm excited to bring these new insights and ideas back to my work and share them with my colleagues.
