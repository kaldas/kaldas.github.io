    <p>I gave him a pen and for a moment our hands touched. From this day and beyond I will never wash my right hand again. That is the story of when I actually met Uncle Bob... but this post is about what I learnt from reading Uncle Bob&#39;s books and how it changed me as a professional software engineer.</p>

<h2>Back in the 2000&#39;s</h2>

<p>I literally couldn&#39;t believe I was being paid to write code. When growing up my mum herself was a web developer and she would work from home a lot. I would look at those awful lines of asp code and think that it was something really cool. Also my favorite movie in the 90&#39;s was The Matrix where lead characters are also developers. It finally happened that people were paying me to write them code and I was very happy.</p>

<h2>Going to Coding Dojo&#39;s</h2>

<p>In my excitement of being a young software developer, I found out about groups of people that would regularly meet and practice being better developers. It was going to Dojo&#39;s that I learnt about Pair Programming and Test Driven Development. It was also how I learnt about a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</a> and this is how I first learnt about Uncle Bob.</p>

<h2>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</h2>

<p>This book teached me long methods were extremely bad, small methods were good, good names were the most important thing, encapsulation was necessary, code comments added noise to the code and are a smell of bad code, the demeter law is sacred and that Solid is boss.</p>

<p>After reading this book a few times, discussing it with my friends, impressing people in pairing sessions... I thought I was a great developer. So I thought...</p>

<h2>How wrong I was!</h2>

<p>The quality of my code had indeed improved by a lot and I started to think I was a great developer. I couldn&#39;t be more wrong. When I was 21 and in my first contracting job I got a formal warning from my client to adjust my behaviour. This was when I learnt the lesson that:</p>

<h2>Good Code &amp;&amp; Bad Behaviour == YouAreFired</h2>

<p>Being a good coder will get you the job. Behaving well will keep you in the job. This is where Uncle Bob helped me again with his book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Clean-Coder-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073">The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers</a>. This book completely changed my view on what it meant to be a professional software engineer. Basically this book will show you the ropes of everything that is expected from you as a software engineer.</p>

<h2>The Software Craftsman: Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride</h2>

<p><a href="">The Software Craftsman</a> is a book penned by Sandro Mancuso and signed by Uncle Bob that picks up where Clean Coder finishes. In my opinion Clean Coder tells you what you should do whilest Software Craftsman tells you how you should do it. This book was extremely important to me because I was feeling demotivated in being a developer. I even thought about being a paraglider instructor full time for a while. Reading this book was also the reason I started this blog.</p>

<h2>Working Effectively with Legacy Code</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052">This is a book penned by Michael Feathers</a> and signed by Uncle Bob. In my opinion this book is one of the three best software engineering books ever written. This is because the book is half technical, half psychological (working with legacy code is extremely frustrating). The most important lesson comes just after the first chapter. This is when you accept that there is no silver bullet to deal with legacy code.</p>

<h2>When I actually met Uncle Bob himself</h2>

<p>This is a story I will tell in another post...</p>
