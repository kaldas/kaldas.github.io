    <p>I don&#39;t know if this is exclusive to the London microservices community but people (not just me) have noticed this. Nima Montazeri from <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> even did a talk called Myths of Microservices.</p>

<h2>The myth: Agile doesn&#39;t work with Microservices</h2>

<p>Some weeks ago I went to a talk organized by the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/">London Software Craftmanship Community</a> and towards the end the speaker then recommended some tools that could be used for some upfront microservice design. At that point I asked myself if that man was really suggesting this (i.e waterfall development). That was when someone in the back of the room actually interrupted him and asked him that question. The speaker then said &quot;agile doesn&#39;t work entirely with microservices because its easier if you do some of the design upfront&quot;.</p>

<h2>Oh boy.. This speaker got himself into serious trouble</h2>

<p>I had never seen a speaker be publicly rebuffed in a talk by the majority of the participants. To put things into context, Agile is to the London Software Craftmanship Community what Prophet Muhammed is to Islamic State militants. In all honesty I felt bad for this speaker.</p>

<h2>Microservices are a new architecture</h2>

<p>In my opinion this is why this is happening. Microservices are a new architecture and people havent yet got confortable with it as they are with SOA or the much older RPC architecture. I reckon this will pass once people get better at it.</p>
