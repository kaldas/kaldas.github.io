          <p>Fact. People don&#39;t understand what Domain Driven Design is about.</p>

          <p>Last thursday I was in a lightning talk where the speaker was honorably trying to motivate an audience of developers to do Pair Programming. Towards the end of the presentation, the speaker discussed the cost of pair programming and this is where I have to beg to differ.</p>

          <p>This is the magna carta of my development team. These are the 6 golden rules that should never be broken. I&#39;ve been a professional software engineer for the last 9 years and these are the rules I put together for my team.</p>

          <p>I gave him a pen and for a moment our hands touched. From this day and beyond I will never wash my right hand again. That is the story of when I actually met Uncle Bob... but this post is about what I learnt from reading Uncle Bob&#39;s books and how it changed me as a professional software engineer.</p>

          <p>I don&#39;t know if this is exclusive to the London microservices community but people (not just me) have noticed this. Nima Montazeri from <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> even did a talk called Myths of Microservices.</p>
