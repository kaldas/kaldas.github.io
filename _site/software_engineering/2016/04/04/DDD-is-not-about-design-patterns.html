    <p>Fact. People don&#39;t understand what Domain Driven Design is about.</p>

<p>Some time ago I took part in a telephone interview as the candidate and I quickly realized the interviewer didn&#39;t know what DDD was about. I know this because I have been there myself. I had my first experience with DDD about 4 years ago when I was contracting for one of the largest pension funds in the world. We were building a system that would manage the pensions of millions of people and I was very proud to be working in this product.</p>

<h2>We thought we were making software the right way</h2>

<p>We were being &quot;pragmatic&quot; in our mix of DDD + CQRS. We thought we were tackling the complexity of managing a pension fund larger than most european countries. We had a team committed to TDD. We had a beautiful implementation of the unity of work pattern for our repositories. We had interfaces for our all Entities and Domain Services. We had quality test coverage. We even had a dedicated full time QA team to serve us.</p>

<h2>We failed miserably</h2>

<p>We weren&#39;t working closely with the domain experts. We didn&#39;t even have an ubiquitous language. What I am going to say sounds absolutely ridiculous but Domain Driven Design is actually all about the Domain - the cool design patterns are an implementation detail.</p>
