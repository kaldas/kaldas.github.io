    <p>Last thursday I was in a lightning talk where the speaker was honorably trying to motivate an audience of developers to do Pair Programming. Towards the end of the presentation, the speaker discussed the cost of pair programming and this is where I have to beg to differ.</p>

<h2>Myth: Pair Programming is expensive because costs twice</h2>

<p>I have been hearing this for many years when people discuss pair programming. Obviously this is based on the idea that two developers working separately will burn twice as much code than working together. Perhaps we can somehow even relate this to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_J._Corbat%C3%B3">Corbato&#39;s Law</a> which states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The number of lines of code a programmer can write in a fixed period of time is the same, independent of the language used.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Traditionally this is where the advocate for pair programming will talk about how the scrum artefacts (i.e team velocity) can be used to decide wether or not to apply pair programming and I agree with this. What I disagree with is that this is the actual cost of pair programming.</p>

<h2>Reality: It&#39;s expensive to hire a committed team</h2>

<p>This a team of passionate software engineers that will embrace pair programming and commit to TDD. They are developers that take pride and responsibility in their work. They care about their product. They will drop their headphones to sit with their colleague and code together in a ping pong session. This is the actual cost of pair programming!</p>
