## What I do

I'm a software engineer focused on high volume distributed systems. I have been busy helping organisations break their legacy monolith application into Microservices and hosting them in the cloud.

## What I advocate

I believe in Test Driven Development (TDD), Continuous Delivery and Pair Programming. I see the purpose of Agile as reaching technical excellence and not just blindly establishing processes and ceremonies. I see the strategic patterns of Domain Driven Design as the way to better understand the Domain of my customers.

## What I like

I like taking ownership of the products I work on and seeing them being used by millions of people. I have been very fortunate to have worked with teams that loved learning new paradigms and trying new technologies. I like working with well tested and modular code but I also like refactoring legacy code into something good that can be maintained.
